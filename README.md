# ENGO-651--LAB3

Targets:
Learn more about Mapbox Vector Tiles and Mapbox Studio.
Design a visually attractive map layer.
Integrate a vector tile to an existing GeoWeb program.

Overview of the study:
In this project, you will learn how to mash the Mapbox-hosted modeled vector tileset with your web mapping framework built in the previous lab. Users would be able to load and access a separate map layer (e.g. Mapbox style) from the Mapbox account. You can use the Mapbox to build and publish a map sheet. Users will now be able to turn on and off the new layer
